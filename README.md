# URI Resolver Wraps
URI resolver wraps are used to extend the built-in resolution capabilities of a Polywrap client. Resolvers are added to the client through its configuration. How to do this will vary based on the client's implementation, please see the [client-readiness repo](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Apolywrap%2Fclient-readiness+path%3A%2F%28%5E%7C%5C%2F%29config_resolver_ext%5C..*%24%2F&type=code) to see how each client supports this.
